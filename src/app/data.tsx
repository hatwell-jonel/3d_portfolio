    When I have free time, I enjoy staying up to date with the latest technology trends by reading and watching industry news. I’m also passionate about running, which helps me maintain both my physical health and mental focus. When I need to unwind or manage stress, I take a break by watching TV series or anime, allowing me to recharge and return to my work with fresh energy.
